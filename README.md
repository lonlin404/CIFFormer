This repository contains the original PyTorch implementation of the paper “CIFFormer: A Contextual Information Flow Guided Transformer for Colorectal Polyp Segmentation”.
To reproduce the code, you need to download the TrainDataset and TestDataset and place them in the dataset folder.

If you need to run the model, you can run the Train.py file directly, and if you need to test the images you can run the Test.py file.

See the log file for relevant training details.
